The following acoustic properties of each voice are measured and included within the CSV:

meanfreq: mean frequency (in kHz)
sd: standard deviation of frequency
median: median frequency (in kHz)
Q25: first quantile (in kHz)
Q75: third quantile (in kHz)
IQR: interquantile range (in kHz)
skew: skewness (see note in specprop description)
kurt: kurtosis (see note in specprop description)
sp.ent: spectral entropy
sfm: spectral flatness
mode: mode frequency
centroid: frequency centroid (see specprop)
peakf: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy)
meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
minfun: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
maxfun: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
meandom: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
mindom: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
maxdom: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
dfrange: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
modindx: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range
label: male or female
